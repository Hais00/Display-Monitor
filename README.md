### How to Use

This app is designed to provide an informative overlay, always visible on the screen, displaying information about sensors. The overlay is currently non-clickable to avoid interfering with other windows.

### Fan Management

The new fan management system offers three modes of operation:  

1. **Curve Mode**:  
   - Dynamically adjusts fan speeds based on the temperature of the monitored sensor.  
   - This mode is active only while the app is running; closing the app restores the fans to their default behavior.  

2. **Forced Mode**:  
   - Sets the fan speed to a fixed value, ensuring consistent performance.  

3. **Automatic Mode**:  
   - This is Appleâ€™s default fan management system. Fans operate based on system firmware and thermal sensors.  

When the app is closed, all fan settings automatically revert to **Automatic Mode**, ensuring seamless transition back to Apple's default management.  

#### Detailed Fan View  
To access the detailed fan management interface, simply click on the **fan text** displayed below the graphs. This will open a comprehensive view of fan-related metrics and controls.
